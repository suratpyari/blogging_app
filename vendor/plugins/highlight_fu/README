HighlightFu
===========
HighlightFu is a simple plugin for highlighting code in your rails applications.
It uses dp.SyntaxHighlighter to do so.

Usage
=====
1. run rake highlight_fu:install to install javascripts and stalesheets
2. on yor page add <%= highlight_include_assets %> to include javascripts and stylesheets 
   for example you can place this in the layout template inside the head tag
3. on the bottom of the page where you want to highlight code put <%= highlight_initialize %>
4. now in the place you want to highlight code use the highlight helper
   <%= highlight @post.body %>

The highlight helpers scans for <pre lang="[LANG]>[CODE]</pre> and replaces that with the proper
highlighting
