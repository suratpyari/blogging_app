= Sitealizer Web Stats plugin for Rails 
This plugin lets you track visitors, referrers, robots, search terms and more. And it shouldn’t influence your site’s performance because it only saves the basic visitor information (after every 10(default) visits) in a threaded process and all the data processing is done when viewing the stats.

== Current Release
The current stable release is v1.1 released on 03-20-2007. 

== License Info
Please refer to the LICENSE[link:files/LICENSE.html]

== Installation
On your Rails' root directory, just type

  script/plugin install http://opensvn.csie.org/sitealizer

and add the following line to your config/routes.rb:

  map.connect '/sitealizer/:action', :controller => 'sitealizer'

== Upgrading from SiteMeter
If you had previously installed 'sitemeter' you need to run the following command after installing Sitealizer, otherwise your stats <b>will not be imported</b>:

  rake sitealizer:remove_sitemeter

You also need to change: 

  * include SiteMeter TO Include Sitealizer
  * before_filter :use_site_meter TO before_filter :use_sitealizer
  * map.connect '/sitemeter/:action', :controller => 'sitemeter' TO map.connect '/sitealizer/:action', :controller => 'sitealizer'

== Configuration
There are four configuration options that can be changed under sitealizer/lib/config.yml:
<em>access_type</em>:: Accepts <em>private</em> or <em>public</em> as the value. <em>Private</em>: you have to enter the username and password below in order to view the stats. <em>Public</em>: Anyone can view your site's stats
<em>username</em>:: This username will be used to log in to your Sitealizer
<em>password</em>:: This password will be used to log in to your Sitealizer
<em>queue_size</em>:: The number of visitors in the queue before saving the stats to the DB. Default is 10. Minimum size shouldn't be under 5

== Usage
To track the visitors on your entire application, just edit your ApplicationController(application.rb):

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include Sitealizer
    before_filter :use_sitealizer
  end

Or to track specific controllers:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include Sitealizer
  end

  class MyController < ApplicationController
    before_filter :use_sitealizer
  end

== Viewing the stats
To view your stats just add "/sitealizer" to your main url:

  http://www.example.com/sitealizer
